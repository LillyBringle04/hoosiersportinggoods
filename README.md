Hoosier Sporting Goods
Project Type: Multi-Page E-Commerce Website
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery
Purpose: This website was created for my Web Design II course. The goal was to create a five page minium website of our choosing utilizing at least one JQuery plugin. The website had to be fully responsive and show a high level of HTML and CSS skills along with strong understanding of Web Design principles. 
My Solution: My solution to this project was to create a multipage e-commerce website for local sporting good store Hoosier Sporting Goods. I used images from their simple e-commerce store and decided the colors and fonts myself. I used the JQuery plugin Cesta Feira for the Add to Cart function.
